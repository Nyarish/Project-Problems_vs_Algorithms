# Explanation_7: Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie

**Requirement:**

For this problem, implement an *`HTTPRouter`* like you would find in a typical web server using the Trie data structure.


**Approach:**

The approach to the problem is described in [HTTPRouter](https://github.com/Nyarish/Project-Problems_vs_Algorithms/blob/master/Problem%20_7_Request_Routing_in_a_Web%20Server%20with%20a%20Trie.ipynb). Which is alos the jupyter notebook to the solution 



**Complexity Analysis:**

*Time complexity: O(mn)*

The worst-case runtime for creating a trie is a combination of `m`, which is the length of the longest key in the trie, and `n`, which the total number of keys in the trie. Thus, the worst case runtime of creating a trie is `O(mn)`.

The time complexity of searching, inserting, and deleting from a trie depends on the length of the word a thatâ€™s being searched for, inserted, or deleted, and the number of total words, `n`, making the runtime of these operations `O(an)`. Of course, for the longest word in the trie, inserting, searching, and deleting will take more time and memory than for the shortest word in the trie.

*Space complexity:*

Splitting a string to store individual parts of the path is dependent on the length of the string and the depth or level of the path, which could be quite large on a site with many pages. In any case, using a dictionary should be `O(n)` where n is the count or number of components in the path.
